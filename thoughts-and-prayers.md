- Different patterns are of different levels of abstraction
  - E.g. `(0 0)` is less abstract than `(x 0)` is less abstract than `(x y)`
  - => Abstract representation and concrete representation in human cognition
- Diffuse evaluation: All patterns that match are evaluated and the new state becomes the superposition of them. Weighted by abstraction.
  - Sparse continuous bit vector encoding
- Probabilistic evaluation: Of all patterns that match, one is chosen randomly. Weighted by abstraction.
- Normal evaluation: Of all patterns that match, the least abstract is chosen.
