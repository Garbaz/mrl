- Different patterns are of different levels of abstraction
  - E.g. `(0 0)` is less abstract than `(x 0)` is less abstract than `(x y)`
  - => Abstract representation and concrete representation in human cognition
- Diffuse evaluation: All patterns that match are evaluated and the new state becomes the superposition of them. Weighted by abstraction.
  - Sparse continuous bit vector encoding
- Probabilistic evaluation: Of all patterns that match, one is chosen randomly. Weighted by abstraction.
- Normal evaluation: Of all patterns that match, the least abstract is chosen.
- Statically check if there is a lhs matching the rhs (We want execution to terminate though, right? Or not?)
- Multiple parallel states (e.g. something like `k(a b c) l(1 2 3) => k(a) (b c)`)
- Multiple independent rule sets (interaction/switch?)
  - Aka. functions ^^ (e.g. instead of the above syntax for parallel states: `f(X Y Z)`)
  - How does this differ from `(f X Y Z)`? Not at all, right?
